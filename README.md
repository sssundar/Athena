# Athena
###### This project was a team effort by Brian Kubisiak and Sushant Sundaresh. It was our final project for CS181a in the spring of 2015 at Caltech. 

# Deliverables
###### We designed from scratch the Athena microprocessor (see athenaSpec.pdf) with the addition of an 8-bit PWM module. We assumed a 1um CMOS process, and laid it out within 1900x1900 square lambda, using the VLSI CAD tool MAGIC. We tested our design and layout using CAST, IRSIM, and SPICE. We optimized the sizing of transistors along the critical path of our design using SPICE. Check out the VLSI layout screenshots to get a feel for the scale of the thing!

# Aside
###### CS/EE181a is a VLSI design course. It can be thought of as an application of the digital design techniques learned in EE119AB. It focuses on transistor physics, arithmetic circuits, tx sizing, clocking schemes, and power distribution. While both EE119B and CS181A require the design of a CPU, in EE119B the 8-bit Atmel AVR CPU is targeted to an FPGA, and the difficulty is figuring out the control flow; in CS181a, the high-level design was the least of our worries.
