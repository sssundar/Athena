# Athena
###### This project was a team effort by Brian Kubisiak and Sushant Sundaresh.
###### It was our final project for CS181a in the spring of 2015 at Caltech. 

# Deliverables
###### We designed from scratch the Athena microprocessor (see athenaSpec.pdf) with the addition of an 8-bit PWM module.
###### We assumed a 1um CMOS process, laid it out using the VLSI CAD tool MAGIC, and tested it using CAST and SPICE. 
###### We optimized the sizing of transistors along the critical path of our design using SPICE. 

# Aside
###### CS/EE181a is a VLSI design course. It can be thought of as an application of the digital design techniques learned
###### in EE119AB. It focuses on transistor physics, arithmetic circuits, tx sizing, clocking schemes, and power distribution.
###### While both EE119B and CS181A have as their project the design of a CPU, in EE119B the 8-bit Atmel AVR CPU is targeted to an FPGA, and so we did not touch on how PLAs & logic was implemented at the transistor level. In CS181a, we did the entire layout ourselves.
